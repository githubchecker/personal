# B2E, B2B, and B2C

Excellent questions. You have hit the exact points that are most confusing for people, and clearing this up is the final step to becoming an expert. You are right to be confused, because the concepts are subtle.

Let's break this down piece by piece using a very clear analogy.

# **The Core Analogy: A Corporate Campus vs. a Public Shopping Mall**

Imagine your company owns a large piece of land.

1. **Your Corporate Tenant (Azure AD):** On this land, you build a secure corporate campus. This is your main Azure AD tenant. It has a high-tech security system.
    - **Employees (B2E):** They work here. They have official company ID badges. Their records are in the main security database.
    - **Contractors (B2B):** A trusted contractor from another firm needs to work in your building for a month. You don't give them an employee badge. Instead, you register their company's ID badge in your system. When they show up, your security guard scans their contractor badge, your system says "Okay, I trust their company," and lets them in. They are a **Guest**. They are in your building, but their identity is managed by their own company.
2. **Your B2C Tenant (Azure AD B2C):** On the same piece of land, but as a **completely separate building**, you build a public shopping mall. This is your Azure AD B2C tenant. The goal of this mall is to attract as many shoppers as possible.
    - **Shoppers (B2C):** These are your customers. They are the general public.
    - You would **never** add shoppers to your corporate security database. That would be a security nightmare and make no sense.
    - Instead, the mall has its own, separate "Customer Loyalty Program." This is the B2C directory. Shoppers can sign up for a loyalty card using any email address they want. The mall manages this separate customer database.

This is the most important concept: **Your Azure AD tenant and your Azure AD B2C tenant are two separate, specialized directories, even though they might be owned and managed by the same company under the same Azure subscription.**

# **Let's Address Your Questions Directly**

### **1. "What do you mean by a separate B2C tenant? An Organization can have only one tenant right?"**

This is the key confusion. An organization has **one primary workforce tenant** (your main Azure AD) for its employees and partners (B2E and B2B).

When you need to build a customer-facing app, you go into your Azure Portal and you create a **new resource**. Just like you would create a Virtual Machine or a Storage Account, you create a resource of the type "Azure AD B2C". The result of creating this resource is an entirely new, separate directory, purpose-built for managing consumer identities.

- **Your Main Tenant:** `mycompany.onmicrosoft.com`. This is where your employees are.
- **Your B2C Tenant:** `mymall.onmicrosoft.com`. This is where your customers will register.

They are both listed in your Azure subscription, but they are isolated from each other.

### **2. "In case of a User registers then will it not appear as @mybusinessdomain.com or its there registered email id?"**

You've hit on a critical difference.

- **In B2B (The Contractor):** The user's identity is **their own work email**. If you invite `john@partnercorp.com`, he will always be `john@partnercorp.com`. He is a guest and you do not control his identity.
- **In B2C (The Shopper):** The user signs up with **whatever email address they want**. This becomes their username.
    - `sally.smith@gmail.com`
    - `gamer123@yahoo.co.uk`
    - `contact@someotherdomain.com`
    - These emails are just used as a unique identifier for their account in your B2C directory. The account itself is a "Local Account" that lives inside your B2C tenant. You are not federating with Gmail in this case; you are just using the email as a username.

### **3. "Is B2B and B2C is totally federation only?"**

No, and this is a crucial distinction.

- **B2B is fundamentally a federation model.** Your tenant is configured to **trust** the partner's tenant. You are delegating the act of authenticating the user to their home identity provider.
- **B2C is a hybrid model that gives you a choice:**
    1. **Local Accounts:** The user creates a username (their email) and a password that is stored and managed **directly by your B2C tenant**. This is **NOT federation**. B2C is acting as the identity provider. This is the "store loyalty card" in our analogy.
    2. **Federation:** You can also configure buttons for "Log in with Google" or "Log in with Facebook." If the user clicks this, B2C *then* acts as a broker and federates the sign-in to that social provider. This is the "accepting a national ID card" part of the analogy.

### **4. "And managing this B2C tenant is billed on my subscription?"**

Yes, absolutely. The Azure AD B2C tenant is a resource within your Azure subscription. However, the billing model is completely different and reflects its purpose:

- **Regular Azure AD (B2E/B2B):** You are primarily billed per-user, per-month for premium features (Licenses like Azure AD Premium P1 or P2). The first 50,000 monthly active users are free.
- **Azure AD B2C:** You are billed based on **Monthly Active Users (MAU)**. This is much more cost-effective for consumer scenarios where you might have millions of registered users, but only a fraction of them sign in each month. The first 50,000 MAU are also free.

# **Final Expert Summary Table: B2B vs. B2C**

| Feature | B2B (Business-to-Business) | B2C (Business-to-Consumer) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Purpose** | **Collaboration.** Let external partners access your corporate resources. | **Engagement.** Let the general public sign up for and use your apps. |
| **Analogy** | The trusted **Contractor** at your secure corporate campus. | The **Shopper** at your separate, public shopping mall. |
| **Azure Service** | A feature within your main **Azure AD Tenant**. | A separate resource: an **Azure AD B2C Tenant**. |
| **User Identity** | The user keeps their **own corporate identity** (`john@partnercorp.com`). | The user signs up with **any email they want** (`sally@gmail.com`). |
| **User Representation** | A "Guest" object in your main tenant (a pointer to an external user). | A "Local" or "Social" account that lives inside the B2C tenant. |
| **Authentication Model** | Primarily **Federation** (you trust the partner's identity provider). | **Hybrid:** Supports both **Local Accounts** (B2C is the provider) and **Federation** (via social providers like Google/Facebook). |
| **Billing Model** | Billed under your main Azure AD licensing (per user/month). | Billed based on **Monthly Active Users (MAU)**. |
