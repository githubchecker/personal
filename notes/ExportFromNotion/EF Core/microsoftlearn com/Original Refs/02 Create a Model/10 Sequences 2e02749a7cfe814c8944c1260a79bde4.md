# Sequences

<aside>
ℹ️ **NOTE:** Sequences are a feature typically supported only by relational databases. If you're using a non-relational database such as Azure Cosmos DB, check your database documentation on generating unique values.

</aside>

A sequence generates unique, sequential numeric values in the database. Sequences are not associated with a specific table, and multiple tables can be set up to draw values from the same sequence.

## Basic usage

You can set up a sequence in the model, and then use it to generate values for properties:

```csharp
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.HasSequence<int>("OrderNumbers");

    modelBuilder.Entity<Order>()
        .Property(o => o.OrderNo)
        .HasDefaultValueSql("NEXT VALUE FOR OrderNumbers");
}

```

Note that the specific SQL used to generate a value from a sequence is database-specific; the above example works on SQL Server but will fail on other databases. Consult your specific database's documentation for more information.

## Configuring sequence settings

You can also configure additional aspects of the sequence, such as its schema, start value, increment, etc.:

```csharp
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.HasSequence<int>("OrderNumbers", schema: "shared")
        .StartsAt(1000)
        .IncrementsBy(5);
}

```
