# Loading Related Data

Entity Framework Core allows you to use the navigation properties in your model to load related entities. There are three common O/RM patterns used to load related data.

- [Eager loading](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/querying/related-data/eager) means that the related data is loaded from the database as part of the initial query.
- [Explicit loading](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/querying/related-data/explicit) means that the related data is explicitly loaded from the database at a later time.
- [Lazy loading](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/querying/related-data/lazy) means that the related data is transparently loaded from the database when the navigation property is accessed.
